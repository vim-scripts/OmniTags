 12 "   This plugin can help you to maintenance tags file.
 13 "
 14 "   There are 3 commands:
 15 "
 16 "     1. :OmniTagsLoad /path/to/tags-file
 17 "
 18 "     Load the tags-file and generate a list of source files indexed by
 19 "     tags-file.
 20 "
 21 "     If tags-file doesn't exist, it can create a null file automaticlly.
 22 "
 23 "     Once tags-file are loaded, every buffer-write event will trigger a
 24 "     re-index operation on current file if current file exists in tags-file.
 25 "
 26 "     The re-index operation will do:
 27 "       a) delete tags of current file from tags-file.
 28 "       b) call "ctags -a" command add the tags of current file to tags-file.
 29 "
 30 "     Therefor, your tags-file will always updated.
 31 "
 32 "     Don't mind the speed of re-index operation, it is indetectable while
 33 "     the tags-file size small than 20MiB.
 34 "
 35 "     2. :OmniTagsUpdate {file1} {file2} ...
 36 "
 37 "     Update the tags-file loaded before, you can specify many files and use
 38 "     wildcards(see ":h wildcards"), "wildignore" option(see "h: wildignore")
 39 "     also influences the result of wildcards parsing.
 40 "
 41 "     If files are not in tags yet, the plugin will add those files to tags,
 42 "     if files already exists, the plugin will update them.
 43 "
 44 "     You can specify no files, for re-index all files that already indexed.
 45 "
 46 "     3. :OmniTagsUnload
 47 "
 48 "     Just an oppsite of :OmniTagsLoad, usually needs not be called by human.
